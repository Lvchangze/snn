The brain is the perfect place to look for inspiration to develop more efficient neural networks. One of the main differences with modern deep learning is that the brain encodes information in spikes rather than continuous activations. 
snnTorch is a Python package for performing gradient-based learning with spiking neural networks.
It extends the capabilities of PyTorch, taking advantage of its GPU accelerated tensor 
computation and applying it to networks of spiking neurons. Pre-designed spiking neuron models are seamlessly integrated within the PyTorch framework and can be treated as recurrent activation units.

snnTorch is designed to be intuitively used with PyTorch, as though each spiking neuron were simply another activation in a sequence of layers. 
It is therefore agnostic to fully-connected layers, convolutional layers, residual connections, etc. 

At present, the neuron models are represented by recursive functions which removes the need to store membrane potential traces for all neurons in a system in order to calculate the gradient. 
The lean requirements of snnTorch enable small and large networks to be viably trained on CPU, where needed. 
Provided that the network models and tensors are loaded onto CUDA, snnTorch takes advantage of GPU acceleration in the same way as PyTorch.

Here are a few ways you can get started with snnTorch:


* `Quickstart Notebook (Opens in Colab)`_

* `The API Reference`_ 

* `Examples`_

* `Tutorials`_

.. _Tutorials: https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/index.html


For a quick example to run snnTorch, see the following snippet, or test the quickstart notebook:


.. code-block:: python

  import torch, torch.nn as nn
  import snntorch as snn
  from snntorch import surrogate

  num_steps = 25 # number of time steps
  batch_size = 1 
  beta = 0.5  # neuron decay rate 
  spike_grad = surrogate.fast_sigmoid()

  net = nn.Sequential(
        nn.Conv2d(1, 8, 5),
        nn.MaxPool2d(2),
        snn.Leaky(beta=beta, init_hidden=True, spike_grad=spike_grad),
        nn.Conv2d(8, 16, 5),
        nn.MaxPool2d(2),
        snn.Leaky(beta=beta, init_hidden=True, spike_grad=spike_grad),
        nn.Flatten(),
        nn.Linear(16 * 4 * 4, 10),
        snn.Leaky(beta=beta, init_hidden=True, spike_grad=spike_grad, output=True)
        )

  # random input data
  data_in = torch.rand(num_steps, batch_size, 1, 28, 28)

  spike_recording = []

  for step in range(num_steps):
      spike, state = net(data_in[step])
      spike_recording.append(spike)


If you're feeling lazy and want the training process to be taken care of:

.. code-block:: python
    
    import snntorch.functional as SF
    from snntorch import backprop

    # correct class should fire 80% of the time
    loss_fn = SF.mse_count_loss(correct_rate=0.8, incorrect_rate=0.2)
    optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(net.parameters(), lr=1e-3, betas=(0.9, 0.999))

    # train for one epoch using the backprop through time algorithm
    # assume train_loader is a DataLoader with time-varying input
    avg_loss = backprop.BPTT(net, train_loader, optimizer=optimizer, 
                            num_steps=num_steps, criterion=loss_fn)

Intelligent Processing Unit (IPU) Acceleration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

snnTorch has been optimized for `Graphcore's IPU accelerators <https://www.graphcore.ai/>`_. 
To install an IPU based build of snnTorch::

  $ pip install snntorch-ipu

Low-level custom operations for IPU compatibility will be automatically compiled when :code:`import snntorch` is called for the first time. 

When updating the Poplar SDK, these operations may need to be recompiled. 
This can be done by reinstalling :code:`snntorch-ipu`, or deleting files in the base directory with an .so extension.

The `snntorch.backprop` module, and several functions from `snntorch.functional` and `snntorch.surrogate`, are incompatible with IPUs, but can be recreated using PyTorch primitives.

Additional requirements include:

* poptorch 
* The Poplar SDK 

Refer to `Graphcore's documentation <https://github.com/graphcore/poptorch>`_ for installation instructions of poptorch and the Poplar SDK.

The homepage for the snnTorch IPU project can be found `here <https://github.com/vinniesun/snntorch-ipu>`_.
A tutorial for training SNNs is provided `here <https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/tutorial_ipu_1.html>`_.
